# Workshop Script

> **Status**: Draft - To be completed in Week 5

## Workshop: Getting Started with Cursor

**Duration**: 30-45 minutes
**Format**: Live demo + hands-on lab + Q&A

## Pre-Workshop Checklist

### For the Presenter
- [ ] Test all demos in advance
- [ ] Verify screen sharing works
- [ ] Have backup examples ready
- [ ] Prepare answers to common questions
- [ ] Share pre-workshop setup instructions 24 hours in advance

### For Attendees
- [ ] Complete setup guide: [docs/setup.md](../docs/setup.md)
- [ ] Install Cursor and verify it launches
- [ ] Have a sample project ready (optional)

## Workshop Agenda

### 1. Introduction (10 minutes)

**Topics to cover:**
- What is Cursor and why we're adopting it
- **Mental model:** Cursor is not autopilot; you verify logic, validate outputs, apply guardrails (see [docs/mental-model.md](../docs/mental-model.md))
- Key benefits for our team (e.g. 4–8x time savings on debugging; faster understanding of complex code — from team feedback)
- Workshop objectives and agenda
- Quick overview of available resources

### 2. Live Demo (20 minutes)

**Demo 1: Project Kickoff (7 minutes)**
[To be documented in Week 5]

**Demo 2: Debugging + code understanding (7 minutes)** — Prefer real-world / company-relevant example; aligns with primary use cases (debugging, logic analysis, understanding unfamiliar code).
[To be documented in Week 5]

**Demo 3: Tips & Tricks (6 minutes)**
[To be documented in Week 5]

### 3. Hands-On Lab (10 minutes)

**Activity: Try It Yourself** — Use a real-world, practical problem; include a step to **validate the output** (run tests or review the diff) so the lab reinforces responsible use.

**What to do:**
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]
4. Validate the output (run/test or review before accepting)

**Helper prompts available in chat**

### 4. Q&A (5 minutes)

**Common questions:**
[To be documented in Week 5]

### 5. Wrap-Up (2-3 minutes)

**Next steps:**
- Share [Mental model / responsible use](../docs/mental-model.md) and [troubleshooting](../docs/troubleshooting.md) (user vs context vs Cursor)
- Share Quick Reference PDF
- Link to GitHub repository
- Share feedback survey
- Mention office hours or support channel
- Preview advanced topics for follow-up session

## Post-Workshop Follow-Up

- [ ] Send recording link
- [ ] Share survey for feedback
- [ ] Share Quick Reference guide
- [ ] Schedule office hours
- [ ] Collect and analyze survey responses
