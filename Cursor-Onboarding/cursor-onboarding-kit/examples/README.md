# Example Workflows

Four guided workflows to learn Cursor by doing. Each example is self-contained; try them in any order, or follow the suggested path below.

## Suggested order

| # | Workflow | Best for |
|---|----------|----------|
| 1 | [Quick project kickoff](01-kickoff/) | Starting a new repo, generating READMEs |
| 2 | [Data summary + analysis](02-data-summary/) | CSV data, stats, quick insights |
| 3 | [Writing flow](03-writing-flow/) | Drafts, docs, emails, job descriptions |
| 4 | [Debugging + code exploration](04-debugging/) | Finding bugs, understanding code, running tests |

**New to Cursor?** Start with [01-kickoff](01-kickoff/) — it’s the lightest and sets up the “ask Cursor, get output” pattern.

**From team feedback:** Debugging and code understanding ([04-debugging](04-debugging/)) are high value; use real-world / company-relevant scenarios where possible.

## Preconditions

- Cursor installed and signed in ([setup guide](../docs/setup.md))
- Basic familiarity with your OS and (for 02/04) the language used in the example

## After you finish

- Try another workflow, or use [docs/prompts.md](../docs/prompts.md) for more prompt ideas.
- Join the live workshop (see [workshop/script.md](../workshop/script.md)) for a walkthrough and Q&A.
