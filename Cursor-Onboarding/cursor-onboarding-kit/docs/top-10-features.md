# Top 10 Cursor Features to Focus On

> **Status**: To be filled in during Week 1 after exploring Cursor docs and teammate interviews.

This list drives which features the setup guide, examples, and workshop emphasize. Update it as you complete discovery.

## List (prioritized for our team)

1. **Code summarization** (SQL, Node.js) — High-value use case; faster understanding of complex logic.
2. **Debugging and logic analysis** — 4–8x time savings reported; primary daily use.
3. **Understanding complex or unfamiliar codebases** — Reduces ramp-up time; effective identification of structure and intent.
4. **Identifying potential bugs and edge cases** — Complements debugging; improves code quality.
5. _[Feature name]_ — _Why it matters for us_ (to be filled from Cursor docs + Interview #2–3)
6. _[Feature name]_ — _Why it matters for us_
7. _[Feature name]_ — _Why it matters for us_
8. _[Feature name]_ — _Why it matters for us_
9. _[Feature name]_ — _Why it matters for us_
10. _[Feature name]_ — _Why it matters for us_
