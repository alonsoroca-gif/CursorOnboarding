## How the onboarding supports these expectations

| Area | In the onboarding app |
|------|------------------------|
| **Priorities & context** | Step 1 lists the expectations above so they are the north star. |
| **Chat / Composer / Reading code** | Feature steps mention ACV narratives, release trackers, discovery docs, backup docs, Jira, triage. |
| **How Cursor supports your PM expectations** | Mapping step: ACV, release trackers, discovery, backup, triage, partners, forecast, sync. |
| **Mental model** | Response times (Slack 4hr, email 24hr) and escalation to managers. |
| **Take it to the next level** | Prompt starters for ACV at-risk narrative, discovery follow-up, backup doc, release tracker, triage, partner follow-up. |

When updating the company expectations, update (1) this doc, (2) `onboarding-pm.js` (steps and HTML blocks), and (3) the mapping table and prompt starters so they stay in sync.
