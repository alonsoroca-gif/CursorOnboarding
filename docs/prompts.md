# Cursor Prompts Guide

> **Status**: Draft - To be completed in Week 4

This guide provides recommended prompt templates and best practices for using Cursor's AI features effectively.

## Prompt Principles

- **Prompt persistence / preserve existing logic:** When you only want a small change (e.g. fix a bug, add a field), say so explicitly so Cursor doesn’t rewrite more than you intend. Example: *“Preserve existing logic/design unless I ask to change it.”* or *“Only change the function body; keep the rest of the file as-is.”* This is especially important when your “source of truth” lives in other tools (e.g. specs or designs) that shouldn’t be overwritten by AI output.
- *(More principles to be added in Week 4.)*

## When to Trust vs Double-Check vs Validate

In Week 4, this section will cover:
- **When to trust Cursor** (e.g. boilerplate, obvious refactors, summarization you can verify).
- **When to double-check** (e.g. security, money, permissions, complex logic).
- **How to validate** (run tests, spot-check, review diff).

See [mental-model.md](mental-model.md) for the full mental model and responsibilities.
