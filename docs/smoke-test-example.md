# Cursor smoke test

Use this file to verify Cursor's AI is working. Open it in Cursor, open Chat (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+L), and ask: *Summarize the first paragraph below.*

---

## Sample paragraph

Cursor is a code editor that integrates AI assistance so you can write, edit, and explore code with natural language. You stay in the driver's seat: you decide what to run, what to commit, and when to double-check suggestions. This smoke test file gives you something concrete to open and query so you can confirm the AI responds as expected.

*After the smoke test, try the mental model (docs/mental-model.md) and example workflows in the repo.*
